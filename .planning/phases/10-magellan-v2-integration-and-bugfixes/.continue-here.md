<current_state>
Phase 10 is fully planned but not yet executed. All 5 plans have been created and verified.

The phase integrates Magellan v2.0.0 graph algorithms into Mirage to enable combined inter-procedural (call graph) and intra-procedural (CFG) analysis.

**Session activities:**
1. Added Phase 10 to ROADMAP.md
2. Created phase directory: .planning/phases/10-magellan-v2-integration-and-bugfixes/
3. Ran gsd-phase-researcher - discovered Magellan 2.0.0 API is production-ready
4. Ran gsd-planner - created 5 plans in 4 waves
5. Ran gsd-plan-checker - verification passed with 2 minor warnings
</current_state>

<completed_work>
- Phase 10 added to roadmap (Phase 10: Magellan v2 Integration & Bugfixes)
- Research completed (10-RESEARCH.md) - Key findings:
  * No compilation errors exist (only warnings for unused imports)
  * Magellan 2.0.0 library API is production-ready
  * Integration is straightforward via local path dependency
- Planning completed (5 plans across 4 waves):
  * 10-01: Add Magellan dependency and create analysis module
  * 10-02: Enhanced reachability (uncalled + unreachable)
  * 10-03: Improved blast zone with call graph
  * 10-04: Cyclic dependency detection
  * 10-05: Code slicing command
- Verification passed with notes about 3 success criteria (8-10) being deferred
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>
- Task 1: Execute 10-01 (Add Magellan dependency + analysis module)
- Task 2: Execute 10-02 (Enhanced reachability command)
- Task 3: Execute 10-03 (Improved blast zone)
- Task 4: Execute 10-04 (Cyclic dependency detection)
- Task 5: Execute 10-05 (Code slicing command)

**Deferred (from checker warnings):**
- Success criteria 8: Inter-procedural dominance analysis
- Success criteria 9: Path-based hotspot analysis with risk scoring
- Success criteria 10: Smart re-indexing using Magellan's graph diff
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>
- Chose local path dependency (`../magellan`) over git for easier development
- Created MagellanBridge wrapper to isolate Magellan API from Mirage codebase
- Split into 5 plans for incremental implementation and testing
- Deferred SC 8-10 as out-of-scope for initial v1.1 release
- No bugfix plan needed (research showed no actual compilation errors)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None

**Notes from checker:**
- Consider renaming phase to remove "bugfixes" since no compilation errors exist
- Consider adding plan to fix 5 unused import warnings if clean builds are required
</blockers>

<context>
The session was focused on PLANNING Phase 10, not execution. The user asked to use the GSD workflow to create a new phase after reading the integration opportunities document (MAGELLAN_V2_INTEGRATION.md).

Key files created:
- .planning/phases/10-magellan-v2-integration-and-bugfixes/10-RESEARCH.md
- .planning/phases/10-magellan-v2-integration-and-bugfixes/10-01-PLAN.md
- .planning/phases/10-magellan-v2-integration-and-bugfixes/10-02-PLAN.md
- .planning/phases/10-magellan-v2-integration-and-bugfixes/10-03-PLAN.md
- .planning/phases/10-magellan-v2-integration-and-bugfixes/10-04-PLAN.md
- .planning/phases/10-magellan-v2-integration-and-bugfixes/10-05-PLAN.md

The verification checker confirmed all plans have valid frontmatter, specific tasks, correct dependencies, and appropriate scope.

<next_action>
To resume: /gsd:execute-phase 10

This will execute all 5 plans in wave order:
1. Wave 1: 10-01 (Magellan dependency + analysis module)
2. Wave 2: 10-02, 10-03 (Enhanced reachability, improved blast zone)
3. Wave 3: 10-04 (Cyclic dependency detection)
4. Wave 4: 10-05 (Code slicing command)

Or start with wave 1: /gsd:execute-phase 10 --wave 1
