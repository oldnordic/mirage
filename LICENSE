                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the work.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of other users.

  For example, if you distribute copies of a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that
you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and authors'
sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so
that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of
previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the purpose of
the GPL, which is to ensure that the software remains free for all its
users.  We therefore will not accept a license that imposes such a
restriction.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents
cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  "You" refers to the the copyright or licensee receiving rights
  under this License.  "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or
  organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
  in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
  exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
  earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
  on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
  permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
  infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
  computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
  distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
  public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
  parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
  a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
  to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
  feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
  tells the user that there is no warranty (or that you can provide support)
  for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that
  licensees may convey, and how to view or copy it.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
  for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source form of a
  work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
  standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
  interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
  is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
  than the work as a whole, that is (a) included in the normal form of
  the Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with
  that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface, for which an
  implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A "Major
  Component", in this context, means a major essential component
  (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
  (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce
  the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
  the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
  work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
  control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
  System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
  programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
  which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
  includes interface definition files associated with source files for
  the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
  linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
  such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
  subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
  can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
  Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
  same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
  copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
  conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
  permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
  covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
  content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
  rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
  measure under this License if it bypasses, subverts or otherwise
  circumvents protection provided by this License for users of the
  Program or modified versions of it.  Conveying a covered work in any
  other way does not circumvent the protection provided by this
  License; conveying a covered work in object code form does not
  circumvent the License if it conveys the source code and the
  corresponding source and/or offers access to the Corresponding
  Source.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
  receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
  appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
  keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
  non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
  keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
  recipients a copy of this License together with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for verbatim copies, and you
  may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
  produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
  terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added in accord with
    section 7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4
    to "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives permission
    to release or publish the work, and allows recipients to relicense the
    whole work under any other license, with all the changes and
    additions to that work.

  You may charge any price or no price for a modified work.  You may
  charge a fee for providing a warranty and/or support for the modified
  work, provided that you also meet all of these conditions.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
  of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
  machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of section 7,
  in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical
    product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by
    the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by
    a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (a) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the features in the
    licensed product, and (b) a copy of this License, which will
    be available -- or that you will make available, on request and at
    no charge -- for a period of at least three years, any third party
    (with a limiting factor of at most five years for revocability
    to any supplier, whichever is more appropriate).  This written
    offer must permit a user to obtain or get a copy of the Corresponding
    Source at no charge, from a network server at your expense, or at no
    cost to you.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
    provided you inform other peers where the object code and
    Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general
    public at no charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
  conveyed in order to convey the object code.

   "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
  tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
  family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
  incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is
  a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
  coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
  "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
  product, and shall not include a product that is (a) normally used for
  a substantial secondary purpose, or (b) a resold product of a type
  in which the value derives primarily from the data it carries or
  from the hardware on which it runs.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
  procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
  install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
  Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The
  information must suffice to suppress all the injunctions against
  installation or execution that would otherwise be imposed by the
  anti-circumvention laws of relevant jurisdictions.

   7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
  License by making exceptions from one or more of its requirements.
  Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
  be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
  that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
  apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
  under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
  this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
  remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
  it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
  removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
  additional permissions on material, added by you to the covered work,
  which you may place under appropriate terms.

  7.1. Invariant Sections.

  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
  are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
  that says that the Document is released under this License.  The
  "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
  designated, in the notice that says that the Document is released
  under this License.

  If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
  is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain
  zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not specify any Invariant
  Sections then there are none.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
  as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
  the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
  be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

   If the Document contains Invariant Sections plus Cover Texts, you must
  treat the Document as modified for the purpose of this section 7.4,
  and the license must say "This License is identical to the GNU GPL,
  except this notice, the Cover Texts and the Invariant Sections, with
  the 'Invariant Sections being listed, with the 'Cover Texts being listed."

  A section "Entitled XYZ" means a sub-unit of the Document whose
  title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
  text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
  specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
  "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
  of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
  section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

  The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
  which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
  Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
  this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
  implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
  no effect on the meaning of this License.

  7.2. License Notices and Acknowledgements.

  You may copy and convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code
  as you receive it, and you may conspicuously and appropriately
  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all
  notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added
  in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of
  the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this
  License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for a copy, and you may offer
  support or warranty protection for a fee.

  7.3. Disclaiming Warranty.

  To the extent possible, disclaim all warranties and convey the
  Program "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, even implied warranties such
  as MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

  7.4. Revising the Document.

  If the Document has Invariant Sections and Cover Texts, you must
  treat the Document as modified for the purpose of this section 7.4.

  If the Document has Invariant Sections and you added new Cover Texts
  to the Document, you must at this time add to the Document a
  section entitled "Endorsements", if it has none, and add an appropriate
  copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other
  copyright notices.

  If the Document has Invariant Sections and you added sections
  qualifying as "Secondary Sections" and Cover Texts, you must treat the
  Document as modified for the purpose of this section 7.4, and license the
  entire Document under this License, to all recipients, with all the
  Section 7 additional permissions.

  You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
  nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
  parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
  been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition
  of a standard.

  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
  Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
  and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made
  by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes a cover text for
  the same purpose, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
  one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
  the old one.

  You may not add Cover Texts that conflict with the previous Cover
  Texts.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
  provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
  modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
  this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
  paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
  license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
  provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
  finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
  holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
  prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
  reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
  violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
  received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
  copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
  receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
  licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
  this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
  reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
  material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
  run copies of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
  occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
  to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
  nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
  modify the covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
  not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
  covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
  receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
  propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
  organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
  organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
  work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
  transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
  licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
  give under the previous section, and a copy of this License, and (c)
  gives the related part a copy of this License; and (d) you make it clear
  that any additional patents applied to that work by the predecessor
  interest remain enforceable and are not licensed to the party receiving
  the copy under section 10.4.  "Upstream" is the party that provides a copy
  of the work to the party receiving a copy, in exchange for payment, and
  "Downstream" is the party that receives a copy from the upstream party.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
  rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you
  may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
  rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
  (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
  any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
  sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
  License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
  Program thus contains the contributions of each contributor.  For the
  purposes of this License, each contributor is referred to as "you".

  A patent license is a license that does not impose material
  restrictions beyond those permitted in this License.

   11.1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
  contributor hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
  no-charge, patent license to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale,
  import, and otherwise transfer the Program, where that license
  applies only to those patent claims licensable by such contributor that
  are necessarily infringed by their contribution alone or by combination
  of their contribution with the Program to which such contribution
  was submitted.  If you institute patent litigation against any
  entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
  that the Program or a contribution incorporated into the Program
  infringes your patent, that patent license terminates as of the
  date of the litigation.

  11.2. Retaining a Copy.

  If you modify a copy of the Program, the copy must contain a
  prominent notice stating that you changed the files and the date of any
  change.  This notice must be placed where a user would easily find it,
  for example, in the "About" box of the application.

  When the Program is part of a collection of programs, each program
  must include a prominent notice stating that it is part of the
  collection, provide a link to the Collection as a whole, and provide
  a copy of this License along with the Collection.

  11.3. Combining Programs.

  You may convey a Program combined with a separate Program (or a
  work based on the Program) under the terms of section 5, provided that
  you include all of the following:

    a) The combined work must contain a prominent notice stating
    that it is a combined work and that it is released under this License.

    b) The combined work must be licensed under this License, and all
    the portions of the combined work must be licensed under this
    License even if the portions have different authors or copyright
    holders.

    c) If the combined work contains a NOTICE file with licensing
    information, the NOTICE file must include the GNU GPL with the
    information required by this section to convey the prominent
    notices, and the GNU GPL must be included in the NOTICE file.

  11.4. Providing the Source.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under this
  License provided you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding
  Source under one of the following methods:

    a) Convey the object code in a physical product, accompanied by
    the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium.

    b) Convey the object code in a physical product, accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years, to give anyone who
    possesses the object code either (a) a copy of the Corresponding
    Source for all the features in the licensed product, or (b) access
    to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a network
    server, with the Corresponding Source available at no charge from
    the same server.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
  from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be conveyed.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
  agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
  License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
  License.  If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey the
  covered work at all.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
  permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
  under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a
  single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of
  this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered
  work, but the Affero General Public License's special requirements
  (section 13) will govern the combined work.

   14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
  the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
  will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
  detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
  Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of
  the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement
  of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that
  version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
  permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
  author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
  later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
  COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
  BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
  AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
  AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
  DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
  CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
  CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
  INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
  DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING
  BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
  LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
  OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS
  BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. If the Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability above
  does not apply, a copyright holder may add a disclaimer of warranty.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
  state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
  "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the
    Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
  notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your commands might use
different names; for instance, show the LICENSE file on request.

  If the program is a substantial work and you want to grant the public
  permission to use and modify it under the terms of some other license,
  you may do so by adding a prominent notice to the program saying that it
  is released under this License with permissions to use and redistribute
  only under the terms of some other license and not under this License.

If you want to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
permission.  For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU
GPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
